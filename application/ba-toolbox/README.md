## ba-toolbox
This project is aimed at providing an alternative to the existing popular Blue Archive fan-made story editor/viewer. The plan is as follows. 

## Planning
Keep in mind I literally just made this repo not that long ago, so everything below is subject to change. 

### Frameworks
This project is planned to be a broswer based application. The server-side operations will be done mostly in `Node.js`, while the front-end will be built on `React.js`. 

### Story Scripting
The stories themselves are planned to be represented by ".archive" files which are json files with a different subfix to avoid confusion. 

### Front-end Rendering & UI
Again, this is (so far) planned to be a `React.js` project as an opportunity for me to learn React. No idea how this will work out cuz I have very minimal experiences in this field. Let's see how this goes. 

### Back-end Rendering
`Node.js` framework will magically handle this. I'm new to it too. We'll see if I manage to break anything. 

### Hosting & Serving Codes
No idea. Right now it's running on magic by Vercel. I've no idea what they use besides that they use `Node.js`. I might change it to `Django` + `Node.js` if I do get my own server for this. 

## About
### Who are you? 
I'm K6MLX. Yes that's a FCC HAM callsign. You can find me on air if you live around California and tune in to CARLA radio system. For more information, please refer to my github.io page at yxu-k6mlx.github.io. 
### Why am I doing this? 
I can't find a job without a proper portfolio, and when I wanted to write some fan-fic for Blue Archive, AzureArchive broke on me. And since that app is built with Unity with no publicly available source code, I can't even help fix it. So I said fuck it and am building an open-source alternative to AA and use this oppotunity to hopefully build a good enough portfolio so someone will hire me lol. 
### Who can contribute? 
If you are interested, please contact me first using all my contacts listed on yxu-k6mlx.github.io, then I will give you my Discord contact. Then we'll go from here.
